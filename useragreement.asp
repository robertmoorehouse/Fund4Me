																<b>ACCRUAL OF 
REBATES</b></SPAN><br>
															5. You will be credited, subject to the 
terms and conditions enumerated in this Agreement, a percentage of the net 
purchases made by you at one of the online merchants affiliated with Funds4Me (an "Affiliated Merchant"). The percentage will be enumerated on Funds4Me Web site as it relates to each Affiliated Merchant. The net purchase is defined 
as the total amount paid to the merchant minus tax, gift wrapping, shipping, 
promotional credits, returns, cancellations, and transaction fees or as the 
Affiliated Merchant defines on their respective Web site and as is enumerated in 
their respective Affiliate Membership and/or Operating Agreement document, 
whichever is less. All Affiliated Merchant Membership and/or Operating 
Agreements as they relate to their affiliate or partner programs with Funds4Me and which reside on the Affiliated Merchant's respective Web sites are hereby 
incorporated into this Agreement by reference. 
<P>6. As a Member, purchases made through  
      Funds4Me Affiliated Merchants will be deemed a "Qualified Purchase" 
      and will be subject to earn a rebate if and only if all of the following criteria 
are satisfied: 1) "Cookies" must be enabled on your Web browser. 2) All potential Qualified 
Purchases must begin by clicking on the Affiliated Merchant's link that appears on the Funds4Me Web site and being successfully connected to the 
Affiliated Merchant's Web site based upon that click. 3) The purchase must be completed during 
the same "session" immediately following a click through to the Affiliate 
Merchant's Web site. A "session" is defined as the time period that begins 
when Criteria #2 is completed and ends when a purchase is 
made at the Affiliated Merchant without an "intervening event". An intervening event is defined as 
any of the following and is deemed to have occurred anytime between Criteria #2 
and purchase of a product or products on the Affiliate Merchant's Web site: 
the Member being disconnected from the Internet for any reason or from any cause; 
the Member closing their web browser software prior to completing a purchase 
in the same session; a Member bookmarking a web page and then subsequently returning to 
that bookmark to complete the purchase; a Member leaving an Affiliated Merchant's Web 
site prior to completing a purchase in the same session whether or 
not the next web page visited is an Affiliated Merchant; any other 
event which causes an interruption between Criteria #2 and purchase of a product or products 
on the Affiliated Merchant's Web site that results in the Affiliated Merchant 
not forwarding a percentage of the sale to Funds4Me. 4) 
You must have your order confirmation sent to your Funds4Me 
email address which we will forward on to your actual email address as recorded in your account details as soon as possible.5)The Affiliated Merchant must be&nbsp;listed as generating a rebate in Funds4Me Database and not be listed as None or Hold.&nbsp; 
<P>7. The determination of whether or not a purchase 
      made through an Funds4Me Affiliated Merchant is a "Qualified 
      Purchase" is at the sole discretion of Funds4Me. 
      <P> 8. "Account Activation" is defined as a Qualified 
      Purchase at any Funds4Me and occurs on the date the first "Qualified 
      Purchase" is credited to our Merchant account. In case of return or cancellation, the 
      Funds4Me retains the right to reverse account                               credit. 
<P>9. Rebates awarded to Members are subject to adjustments for returns, 
cancellations, and other events. Such adjustments can be applied to Member 
accounts at any time by Funds4Me at its sole discretion. Should you disagree 
with any adjustments made to your account, your sole remedy is to withdraw from 
the Program. Cash Back amounts are shown after the store name and as a maximum value. The actual value of the cash back will be dependant on several factors. Examples of this type of factor include but are not limited to sliding scale rebates, where the rebate amount is dependant on the total
membership spend over a finite period of time.&nbsp; 
<P>10 You may be taxed on your accrual of rebates, depending on the amount of 
rebates you accrue and the tax laws of federal, state, and local jurisdictions. Funds4Me will provide you with a detailed statement of cash back payments, you will be responsible for any and all tax liability arising out of your 
accrual or redemption of rebates. 
<P>11. You will be credited the full amount of the rebate which we receive from 
the Affiliated Merchant subject to the following exceptions: 1) In the case that 
an Affiliated Merchant pays Funds4Me a different percentage of the net 
purchase price based upon the aggregate net purchases made during a finite 
period of time delineated by the Affiliated Merchant, the Member will rebated 
the actual amount paid by the Affiliated Merchant at the date of the rebate being awarded. At this time, only a handful of Affiliated Merchants implement 
this sliding scale rebate structure. 2) Should the Affiliated Merchant withhold 
an portion of your rebate for any reason whatsoever, Funds4Me will withhold 
the exact same amount from your rebate for the Qualified Purchase.<P>12. The following purchases are not eligible for accrual or payment of 
rebates: Any purchase from a site identified as having (none) as their rebate amount in our stores database. Purchases made not following the procedure in section 6. Any purchase made where the Affiliated Merchant does not pay Funds4Me a sales commission. Purchases of goods from an
Merchant that the merchant does not pay commission on.<BR><BR>Referral and affiliate revenues will not include a percentage of 
monies placed in member rebate accounts resulting from a special promotion or any payments made by Funds4Me to an member. 
Examples of this type of promotion include but are not limited to promotions 
from KBkids.com and Ice.com. 
<P>13. It is your responsibility to check your account regularly to ensure that 
rebates have been properly credited and that your account balance is accurate. 
The Member must inform Funds4Me of any rebates that the Member believes they 
are entitled to within 30 days of the Member's claim of a valid Qualifying 
Purchase. Furthermore, all rebates earned by Members are subject to review. 
Necessary adjustments may be applied to Member accounts at any time by Funds4Me at its sole discretion. If you do not agree to adjustments made to 
your account, your only recourse will be to terminate your membership in the 
Program. Funds4Me reserves the right to terminate any account for abusive or 
fraudulent activity, or if the Member is no longer reachable at the e-mail 
address provided.<P>14. Funds4Me is not responsible 
                        for changes to, or discontinuance of, any Affiliated 
                        Merchant, or any Affiliated Merchant withdrawal from the 
                        Program, or for any effect on accrual of rebates caused 
                        by such changes, discontinuance, or withdrawal.</P>

                        consent. Subject to that restriction, this Agreement

                        of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a
