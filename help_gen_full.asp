				Well we have to pay for our sites as we 
                  are not a charity. <BR><BR>We faced a question, do we pay a 
                  flat % on each store like ebates, spree and other sites do, or 
                  do we pay what is actually paid by a merchant in to members 
                  accounts and then deduct our admin fee.<BR><BR>We decided on 
                  the later because not all merchants pay a flat fee. Many 
                  merchants pay an increasing commission depending on how much 
                  business is sent to them from our site. Doing it our way means 
                  that you benefit from any increase in commissions, and bonuses 
                  paid by a merchant.<BR>
