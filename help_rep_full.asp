				    There are two reasons. First, to provide an accurate 
summary of purchases, we post the data we receive from merchants daily.&nbsp;It takes 
time for the merchant to report on orders and to pass 
the&nbsp;purchase data to Funds 4 Me. Second, Funds 4 Me receives purchase information from 
merchants at different times - some merchants provide purchase information a few 
days after your purchase and others take several weeks. If your purchase is not 
on your report after eight weeks, <A href="contact.asp">click 
here</a> to submit a customer service question about your report.

				Most merchants only provide a rebate on the net sales amount. They exclude 
other charges that appear on your statement including gift certificates, gift 
wrapping, sales tax, shipping and handling. Additionally, some stores may 
exclude purchases like alcohol and tobacco from your funds.
In addition, some stores take up to 6 weeks to report your funds back to us, so your account will not immediately show your funds after you went shopping.
